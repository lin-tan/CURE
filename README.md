# CURE: Code-Aware Neural Machine Translation for Automatic Program Repair
A pytorch implementation of paper [CURE: Code-Aware Neural Machine Translation for Automatic Program Repair](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/lintan/publications/cure-icse21.pdf)

## File Structure
* **results**: This folder contains all the bugs in both Defects4J and QuixBugs benchmarks that CURE fixed. Each file contains the buggy line, CURE's patch and the developer's patch
* **candidate_patches**: This folder contains all the candidate patches CURE generated for bugs in each benchmark
* **data**: This folder contains the vocabulary file, subword tokenizer, some training data examples, and the GPT PL model pre-trained on code.
  * **vocabulary**
    * subword.txt: the subword tokenizer model needed by subword-nmt
    * vocabulary.txt: the vocabulary file used in CURE's paper
  * **models**: This folder is used to save the models
    * code_gpt.pt: the save GPT PL model trained on code
  * **patches**: This folder is used to save the generated patches
    * gpt_conut_1.txt: an example file that contains the candidate patches generated by a GPT-CoNuT model, including 100 patches for each QuixBugs bug.
    * gpt_fconv_1.txt: an example file that contains the candidate patches generated by a GPT-FConv model, including 100 patches for each QuixBugs bug.
  * **data**: This folder is used to save the training data and validation data
    * CURE uses the source code training data shared by previous work [CoCoNuT](https://github.com/lin-tan/CoCoNut-Artifact)
* **src**: This folder includes the source code for CURE's APR model

## Dependency
* Python 3.8
* PyTorch 1.4.0
* NumPy 1.18.1
* Huggingface transformers 2.10.0
* subword-nmt

## Usage
**To train a GPT-CoNuT model**, run `src/trainer/gpt_conut_trainer.py`
Some settings you may need to change:
  * vocab_file: the path to the vocabulary file used by the model
  * train_file: the path to the training data
  * valid_file: the path to the validation data
  * gpt_file: the path to the saved GPT PL model
  * hyper_parameter: the hyper-parameter of the model (including the number of encoder/decoder layers, dropout rate, etc.)
  * save_dir: the directory to save the model, default: data/models/

**To train a GPT-FConv model**, run `src/trainer/gpt_fconv_trainer.py`
Some settings you may need to change:
  * vocab_file: the path to the vocabulary file used by the model
  * train_file: the path to the training data
  * valid_file: the path to the validation data
  * gpt_file: the path to the saved GPT PL model
  * hyper_parameter: the hyper-parameter of the model (including the number of encoder/decoder layers, dropout rate, etc.)
  * save_dir: the directory to save the model, default: data/models/

**To prepare input for new test data**, check `data/data/prepare_testing_data.py`, make sure you check the readme file and follow the three steps to prepare the test input.

**To generate patches**, run `src/tester/generator.py`
Some settings you may need to change:
  * vocab_file: the path to the vocabulary file used by the model
  * input_file: the input data to the model for generating patches, with each line referring to a bug in the following format: `buggy line <CTX> surrounding function`. see `candidate_patches/QuixBugs/quixbugs_bpe.txt` for reference. 
  * identifier_txt_file: the valid identifiers for each bug, with each line being a list of valid identifiers, identifiers are split by space. see `candidate_patches/QuixBugs/identifier.txt` for reference
  * identifier_token_file: the tokenized identifiers for each bug, with each line being a list of valid identifiers tokenized by camel letter, underscore, and subword. identifiers are split by `\t`. see `candidate_patches/QuixBugs/identifier.tokens` for reference
  * output_file: the path to the output result
  * beam_size: the number of candidate patches generated by each model
  * model_file: the path to the saved APR model
  * CURE's trained models: https://zenodo.org/record/7030145#.YwvXfFvMI5l
  
`data/patches/gpt_conut_1.txt` and `data/patches/gpt_fconv_1.txt` are example candidate patches generated by GPT-CoNuT and GPT-FConv models for QUixBugs benchmark.

**To validate the candidate patches generated by models**, run `src/validation/rerank.py`, which will rerank the patches generated by all the models and the result will be dumped into `data/patches/reranked_patches.json`, then run `src/validation/validate_quixbugs.py` or `src/validation/validate_defects4j.py`, which will run unit test cases (offered by Defects4J or QuixBugs) to validate the candidate patches. The final result will be dumped into `data/patches/validated_patches.json`
